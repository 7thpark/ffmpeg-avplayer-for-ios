A powerful video player SDK for iOS. The SDK can play the most audio and video formats (Includes network audio and video streams), no convert hassles.

AVPlayer SDK is written for iOS developers who want to add powerful video player to their app using a couple lines of code. Behind the scenes Video Player relies on the iOS OpenGL ES 2.0 framework and the open source LGPL licensed FFmpeg library.

**Note**: Although AVPlayer SDK supports 1080p video, but video frame rate is very low on current iOS devices.
